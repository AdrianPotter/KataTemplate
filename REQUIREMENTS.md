# Context

Our users would like a to-do list application. It should support at least 100 items. The user is not at all picky about the type of application (e.g. CLI, API), but they need it for a workshop in an hour's time.

# Must
- Add new items to the list
- Remove items from the list
- View the items currently on the list

# Should
- Prevent adding duplicate items
- Allow items to be marked as completed
- View a list of completed items

# Could
- Allow completed items to be uncompleted
- Allow items to be modified (e.g. spelling corrections)
- Show the list of outstanding items
- Show the list of completed items
- View a list of deleted items
- Allow all lists to be sorted ascending and descending according to:
    - Date added
    - Date modified
    - Alphabetical
- Show the added and last modified dates on each item list
